The project was based on predicting full season batting averages using statistics from March and April.

Data was provided for the players of interest so all I needed to do was build the model.

There are two models in the repository and a Jupyter Notebook for the final model:

1) Bayesian inference model based on some projects I saw online. It was very simple and didn't perform well.

2) XGBRegression model using the Top 5 features for predicting batting average.
