The project was based on predicting full season batting averages using statistics from March and April.

Data was provided for the players of interest so all I needed to do was build the model.

There are two models in the repository and a Jupyter Notebook for the final model:


1) XGBRegression model using the Top 5 features for predicting batting average.

2) Multiple Linear Regression model using all of the features provided.

2) Multiple Linear Regression model using the same 5 features as the XGB model.

A write up on this project and what I learned from it will be up on my blog soon at:
